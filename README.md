*Installation*:
    - Extract the files from the zip folder after downloading into the server directory you are using, and restart the server.

*NOTE*: If there is a bug tell us, If you did edits to these scripts yourself and you encounter a bug, It's not out fault, Yet we will try to fix it for you regardless.
